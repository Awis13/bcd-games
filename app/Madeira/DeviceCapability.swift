//  What this device's GPU and CPU can run: logged at start-up and checked before a game
//  starts (2026-10-18, docs/research/ios18-2026-10-18/gameplay.md section 1.1).
//
//  iOS 18 brings devices iOS 26 does not support: the iPhone XS, XS Max and XR (A12) and the
//  7th-generation iPad (A10); the A12 iPads run iPadOS 26 as well. Their GPUs have Tier 1
//  argument buffers. DXMT (Direct3D 9/10/11) and the D3D12 runtime write GPU addresses and
//  resource IDs straight into argument buffers, which Metal allows on Tier 2 only (A13 and
//  later): there a game drew garbage, faulted the GPU or was ended by it. The A10 also lacks
//  the LSE atomics and LDAPR that the 64-bit emulator module (xtajit64.dll) is compiled with,
//  so every 64-bit program stopped at its first such instruction. Nothing said why.
//
//  Now:
//  - "[device] gpu=..." names the GPU family, the argument-buffer tier and the CPU features;
//  - a game is refused with a message on a Tier 1 GPU, and a 64-bit program on a CPU without
//    LSE or LDAPR; the Desktop still starts there (what runs in it is the user's choice);
//  - an A13 (no mesh shaders, so no geometry shaders or tessellation) gets a one-time notice.
//  An A14 or later device answers yes to everything: no refusal, no notice, only the log line.
//  env.MADEIRA_DEVICE_GATE = 0 starts games anyway (on such a GPU they crash or draw garbage).
