//  GameRecommendations.swift
//  Madeira
//
//  madeira-bcd: the settings Madeira recommends for the games it has been
//  tested with, shipped in the app (owner's decision, 2026-10-09).
//
//  A recommendation is the game's own config file (GameProfiles.swift,
//  bcd.cfg syntax) plus the switches the game's settings page keeps
//  elsewhere: AVX, Report an NVIDIA GPU, Wine's C++ runtime, the fastsync
//  switches, the FPS limit, the resolution and the scaling. A game that
//  arrives with no config of its own gets its recommendation once (a Steam
//  install, a game added by hand, a game already in the library);
//  "Reset to Recommended" at the bottom of its settings brings it back at
//  any time (GameRecommendationsApply.swift).
//
//  The lists are data since 2026-10-18 (owner's decision): recommended/recommendations.json,
//  which every build bundles and BCD's public repository serves, signed, so a game fixed by a
//  new line gets it without a new build (GameRecommendationsList.swift reads the format,
//  GameRecommendationsSource.swift fetches and checks it). The app uses the newer of its own
//  copy and the last good download; `active` below is that list.
//
//  How a game is recognised (each rule's "match"; the first rule that matches wins):
//    - A library Steam game by its App ID or by its folder under
//      steamapps\common, which Steam keeps the same from build to build.
//    - A program by its file name, wherever it was installed; only the
//      game's own programs count, not a redistributable in its folder.
//    - GTA V Enhanced by PlayGTAV.exe (or GTA5_Enhanced.exe) beside
//      GTA5_Enhanced.exe: inside a Steam library it is the Steam copy,
//      anywhere else another copy, and each has its own list. Red Dead
//      Redemption 2's RDR2.exe and PlayRDR2.exe the same way.
//    - GTA V Legacy only from Steam: App ID 271590, the folder "Grand
//      Theft Auto V", GTA5.exe, or PlayGTAV.exe beside GTA5.exe and without
//      GTA5_Enhanced.exe (Enhanced is checked first).
//    - Any other game gets the standard list (owner's decision, 2026-10-12;
//      GameRecommendationsApply.swift); only the Desktop gets none.
//
//  This file is Foundation only: tests/host/check-game-recommendations.py
//  compiles it with a test harness. The lists are the working ones recorded
//  in the private notes (OYUN-AYARLARI); a game that gets a newer working
//  list gets it in recommended/recommendations.json too, with a higher rule
//  `version` and a higher file `version` (with every build, owner's order
//  2026-10-09; tools/publish-recommendations.py checks and signs it).
