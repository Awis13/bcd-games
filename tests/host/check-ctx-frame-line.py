"""env.MADEIRA_CTX_FRAME = 1 for the Unity stop that follows a garbage collection (build 598); no Wine runs.

The Wine server can report a thread parked in a system call by its saved call frame instead of the Mach-O registers it happens to be
executing (ml716, build/wineserver/mach_ios.c; off unless MADEIRA_CTX_FRAME is 1). Build 592's Unity logs (No Rest for the Wicked GGFKAY and
RKZSCQ, and 29 more of seven other titles) show NtGetContextThread answering a collector's stopped threads with the Mach-O state
("[ec-getctx] ml715 ... is_ec=0 ... native_pc=0x2501e8ae8") and the object-header stop ("[badrip]") a few dozen lines after the last burst.
Round 2026-10-24 offers the existing switch to that stop, opt in: the list line of No Rest for the Wicked (version 4, build 598) and the
auto-tune rule unity-gc-stopped-thread-context. This check holds the pieces together:

  - the server reads the switch once, by name, and only the value "1" turns it on; the substitution is gated by it and by the same test as
    Wine's own suspend path (the stack pointer lies between the thread's kernel stack and its syscall frame), and falls through otherwise;
  - the list policy knows the name and takes 0 or 1 only (the Swift harness of check-remote-recommendations.py runs the values);
  - only No Rest for the Wicked's list carries the line, from build 598, and its version is 4;
  - the auto-tune rule's line, signals and outcome, and a fixture whose log really has the burst and the stop.
Needs python3 only.
