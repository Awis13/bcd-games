"""env.MADEIRA_APC_BUSY_QUEUE: an async I/O completion for a running thread stays with it when nobody else can take it; no Wine runs.

The EA app installer (build 593, the owner's iPhone18,2, log 17:15:17): the bundle reached its MSI package and the package stopped at
its first custom action, "JunoInitializeSession" (1603, INST-14-1603). The action is a WiX DTF managed custom action. msiexec's custom
action server (syswow64\\msiexec.exe -Embedding) loads the action's DLL (SfxCA.dll 3.11, saved as msif50e.tmp), which starts
rundll32.exe; rundll32 hosts Wine Mono and asks the server for every MSI call over an overlapped named pipe (RemoteMsiSession: write
the request, then ReadFile for the answer and wait on the OVERLAPPED event). rundll32 has ONE thread until the CLR starts. The server's
first answer arrived while that thread was running, not waiting in the server. BCD's own Windows server cannot interrupt a running
thread on iOS (send_thread_signal always fails), so queue_apc asks ios_apc_requeue_target for another thread of the process that waits;
there was none, and the APC was dropped ("[apc-requeue] #4 async I/O APC status=00000101 for busy thread 01c0 -> dropped, no waiting
thread"). thread_apc_destroy then completes the async with the APC's own status and no data: a pipe read that had data ends with
STATUS_ALERTED (0x101) and zero bytes. SfxCA's ReadPipe takes that for a failure and closes its end of the pipe (the server's read ends
with STATUS_PIPE_BROKEN, c000014b: the next [apc-requeue] line), its later Log() reads the answer of a request through a NULL pointer
(msif50e.tmp+0x409C, `mov esi,[eax+4]`: "wine: Unhandled page fault on write access to 00000004 at address 74AF409C") and the managed
RemotableNativeMethods does the same through Marshal.ReadInt32(NULL) (two NullReferenceException faults at guest address 0 in Mono's
JIT code). Not Wine Mono, not FEX: the libmono address in the log's stack (+0x354363) is a pointer into its .rdata (a function-name
string of the GC-safe-region code), and 0x74AF409C is in SfxCA, not libmono (whose image ends at 0x74984000).

Held here (the Wine source is wine/ of this checkout, $BCD_WINE_SRC, or ~/madeira-bcd/wine; the parts that read it are skipped when
none is there, and fail when the one that is there is the commit this checkout pins and lacks the change):
  1. The reasoning's links in the Wine source: async_terminate gives STATUS_ALERTED to an async with output data, thread_apc_destroy
     completes an undelivered APC_ASYNC_IO with that status and 0 bytes, queue_apc asks ios_apc_requeue_target when the signal fails,
     every wait in NtWaitForSingleObject/NtWaitForMultipleObjects is interruptible, check_wait returns STATUS_KERNEL_APC to one.
  2. The change: the new function reads only MADEIRA_APC_BUSY_QUEUE and only the value 1 turns it on; the new line in
     ios_apc_requeue_target comes after the search for a waiting thread, needs no waiting thread, no in-process engine
     (thread->alert_sync, madsync) and the switch; the two old log texts are unchanged.
  3. The real ios_apc_requeue_enabled, ios_apc_busy_queue_enabled and ios_apc_requeue_target, extracted from thread.c and compiled on the
     host against stand-in types, next to the ORIGINAL functions (the text of the pinned commit's thread.c before this change), over
     every combination of switch (unset, 0, empty, 2, yes, 1), MADEIRA_APC_REQUEUE (unset, 0), APC type, waiting thread, suspended
     thread, terminated thread and in-process engine: with the switch anything but 1 the target AND everything written to stderr are
     the original's, byte for byte; with 1 only "no waiting thread, requeue on, async I/O APC, no in-process engine" differs (the
     target is the busy thread itself) and the log says so.
  4. The EA launcher entry sets the line (and Battle.net's does not), auto-tune's rule eaapp-installer-msi-pipe-answer-lost adds it
     after "JunoInitializeSession returned 1603" only, its fixture proposes it, the settings catalog knows the key, the CI runs this.
Needs python3 and a C compiler.
